###
This project was created as a requirement on the KodeGo Bootcamp.

It is a website for a fake Outsourcing Company that provides Software Developement services.

The name of the page is Koders which is derived from the Bootcamp's name which is KodeGo. 

We are very proud of the knowledge KodeGo has provided us and this is a proof of what we can do just in 6 weeks. 

####
This site uses localStorage as a fake back-end. Thus, it is always suggested to do localStorage.clear() when first using the website. However, please never use it if you already have saved data.

####
For localStorage manipulation, you may go to /admin-page. it contains everything that is saved in the localStorage. It will also provide you options to delete data entry for both localStorages.
